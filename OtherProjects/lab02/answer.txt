Question:
- If you create a constructor method to build a DVD by title then create a constructor method to build a DVD by category. Does JAVA allow you to do this?
Answers: 
Yes, Java allows the creation of multiple constructors within the same class, as long as each constructor has a different parameter list, known as constructor overloading. So, we can create a constructor to build a DigitalVideoDisc (DVD) by title and another to build it by category.
